# Using Machine Learning to Classify Exoplanets with 40 Features
While data cleaning and visualization prove to be valuable core skills in the world of data analysis, beyond them are even more powerful techniques and tools that unlock the potential of what data can be. Machine learning gives us the power to create statistical models to make predictions as well as classifications. In the following project, we will be using various tools in the `scikit-learn` library to analyze a dataframe consisting of 40 columns in order to classify masses in space as potential exoplanets with close to 90% accuracy.
